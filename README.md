# Introduction

Misspellings lead IR systems to provide bad results without users even realizing their mistakes. Users assume that the system lacks quality, which decreases their satisfaction and likelihood of returning to the system. We detected the misspelling problem in the Portuguese Web Archive. 

# Old methodology

Hence, we analyzed existing solutions for spelling suggestion and integrated the solution that provided the best results in our user interface.

The following [technical report Query Suggestion for Web Archive Search](https://sobre.arquivo.pt/en/technical-report-analyses-query-suggestion-for-web-archives/) describes the old methodology adopted and the obtained results based on this [Portuguese Dataset](http://www.linguateca.pt/Repositorio/CorrOrtog/).

However, there are several problems with this methodology:

1. Legacy Technology.
2. High cost of maintenance and updgrade.
3. Space to store indexes on the servers.

# New methodology

The new methodology used is based on the Bing Search API, in particular the [Bing Spell Check API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-spell-check-api)

Parameters:

**host** + **path** + "?mkt=" + **lang** + "&" + "mode=" + **mode** + "&" + "text=" + **query**

1. **host** = https://api.bing.microsoft.com;
2. **path** = /v7.0/SpellCheck;
3. **mode** = spell;
4. **lang** is the languague selected in arquivo.pt;
5. **query** is the query submitted by the user;
